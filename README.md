# Long-calendar

A calendar-like visualization presenting your life tracking data over long periods of time.

It displays one vertical line per day, stacked horizontally with the most recent day last.

It can present two types of data: instant events (zero duration) and segments (have a start and stop).

## Usage

For development mode (with hot reloading):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/egeres/Long-calendar.git
cd Long-calendar
npm install
npm start
```

To generate data from a local ActivityWatch instance, run:

```bash
python data_generator_activitywatch.py
```
